# 🎙️ Auction Voice Agent - Hackathon Prototype

## 🚀 Project Title:
**OmniDimension Auction Voice Agent**

## 📝 Problem Statement:
We developed a voice-based agent that allows users to participate in live auctions via phone calls or web calls. The system assists users in:

- Listing available auction items.
- Providing real-time current bids.
- Accepting new bids if they are higher than current bids.
- Confirming successful or rejected bids based on logic.

This solves the problem of enabling hands-free, real-time auction participation via natural voice interface.


## 🎯 Key Features:

- ✅ Voice AI Assistant built on OmniDimension platform (Text-Based Flow Setup)
- ✅ Real-time auction logic handled via AI prompt
- ✅ Web Call simulation for demo and testing
- ✅ Fully functional working prototype


## 🛠 Tech Stack:
